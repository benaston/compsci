##Data Structures & Algorithms

###Bubble Sort

Data structure: Array.

Complexity:<br/>
Worst case performance	`O(n^2)`<br/>
Best case performance	`O(n)`<br/>
Average case performance	`O(n^2)`<br/>
Worst case space complexity	`O(1)`<br/>

*Repeatedly step through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.*
